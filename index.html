            <h1>Numismatics: The Impact of Coins throughout History</h1>
            <p1>This website is meant to examine coins from Augustus' reign in the Roman Empire and how historians use coins</p1>
        </div>
        <div id="Section2">
            <h1>What are Numismatics?</h1>
            <p>Numismatics are the study of coins in history. Researchers examine coin locations as well as physical appearances to draw conclusions about the Roman world.</p>
            <h2>Physical Appearence of Coins</h2>
            <p>Coin appearances offer insight into who produced the coin and specific values the ruler possessed. Inscriptions on the coin can also identify who minted the coin and who was in charge of producing coins during an emperor’s rule. Coins are composed of two sides, the obverse (front) and the reverse (back).</p>
            <h3>The Obverse</h3>
            <p>Typically depicted a bust of a divine figure or the emperor at the time. Also included inscription of the Emperor’s name</p>
            <br>
            <img src="ObverseCoin.jpg" id="obverseCoin">
            <br>
            <h4>The Reverse</h4>
            <p>Usually a symbol that represents an emperor’s values. Can also be a monument or a building that was particularly important to the emperor</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Other Ways to Examine Coins</h2>
            <h3>Coin Locations</h3>
            <p> 
                While the physical aspects of coins are important, the key to examining coins lies beyond
                the physical appearance of the coin itself. Historians are able to discern a lot more information
                from where the coins are found as well as how many of them are found in each location. The
                distribution of coins as well as their production allows for more interpretive conclusions. The
                concentration of coins in certain areas represent areas that were heavily involved in commerce
                and indicated where the heart of Rome’s economy was at the time. Another interpretation could
                also be due to times of unrest and war, as many people would be killed or forced to flee and 
                leave their currency behind. A sharp increase in coin production could also confirm when
                significant wars took place. As stated previously, coin production was generally increased during
                times of war in order to pay soldiers. This conclusion reinforces that Augustus ruled during a
                time of peace.
            </p>
            <h3>Coin Compositions</h3>
            <p>
                Besides the physical inscriptions on coins, modern technology has allowed researchers to examine coin composition to confirm inferences about the Roman world. Modern methods such as studying oxidation levels and corrosion levels allow researchers to identify the exact age of the coin as well as the chemical composition. This is important as the chemical composition indicates the purity of the coin as well as when that purity changed over time. The depurifying of coins was known as debasement which occurred when more currency needed to be created to fund armies during times of war/unrest. Researchers discovering the debasement of coins over time indicates when Rome was facing hard times/wars and also indicates when Rome was facing periods of peace.

            <h1>Augustus</h1>
            <img src="Augustus.jpg" id="Augustus">
            <br>
            <p>Augustus was Rome’s first emperor. He was born in 63 BC and ruled from 27 BC until his death in 14 AD. During his reign as Rome’s first emperor, he was part of several crucial reforms that lasted hundreds of years. Of these reforms, Augustus’ reform to currency and coins is one of the longest lasting legacies of his rule. He ruled during a period of peace that lasted roughly 200 years known as the Pax Romana. This enabled him to focus primarily on growth and trade and was one of the few peaceful eras in the Roman Empire. The coins produced under Augustus reveal trade paths as well as virtues Augustus had during this peaceful era in Roman history.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Augustus' Coin Reform</h2>
            <p>Augustus’ coin reform was a pivotal decision that helped stabilize Roman economy for nearly 200 years. He introduced smaller denominations below that denarius and used a zinc copper alloy to create these coins. He also minted new gold and silver coins without changing their weight/finesse. The currency he introduced would be used for nearly 200 years before losing its value, far outliving his rule in Rome.</p>

            <h1>Examples of Datasets</h1>
            <img src="Aureus.png" id ="Aureus">
            <p>This coin is called the Aureus. It was one of the gold minted coins in Augustus' reign. The coin depicts Augustus on one side and a tortoise-shell lyre on the other. Further analsysis can be found under "Research Paper" on the website.</p>
            <img src="CoinBuilding.jpg" id="BuildingCoin">
            <p>This coin is an example of a building/monument being depicted on the reverse. This building is the Arch of Augustus and is one of the oldest Roman arches.</p>
            <img src="graph.png" id="Graph">
            <p>This graph breaks down coin production throughout the Roman Empire by year. As we can see, coin production was relatively low during Augustus' reign. An analysis can be found in the "Research Paper" section.</p>
            <img src="Map.png" id="Map">
            <p>This map depicts the location coin hoards from Augustus' era was found. These locations reveal the economic center for trade and commerce around Augustus' era.</p>
            <h2>Quick Analysis</h2>
            <p1>- When examing the Aureus, we can see that the coin was produced under Augustus' reign</p1>
                <br>
                <p1>- The inscription on the reverse of the Aureus reveals the mint magistrate, or the person in charge of producing the coin</p1>
                <br>
                <p1>- The symbol of a lyre represents peace and unity: ideals that were prevalent during the peaceful era in the Roman Empire under Augustus</p1>
                <br>
                <p1>- The silver coin (Denarius) is an example of a coin with a building inscription on the reverse</p1>
                <br>
                <p1>- The graph shows coin production being less during Augustus' reign in comparison to the other years</p1>
                <br>
                <p1>- This drop in production suggests a peaceful era and lack of war and thus a lack of need to produce more currency</p1>
                <br>
                <p1>- The distribution of coins found from Augustus' reign indicates heavy trade/purchases from the East</p1>
                <br>
                <p1>- It is important to note that the coins under Augustus lasted beyond his reign and thus we can only generalize the trade routes

            <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
            <p>
                - In the early Roman Republic times, currency was often bars of material rather than coins
                <br>
                - The term 'coin' came from the word 'consecratio' which was issued by the Emrpror to pay homage to their deceased family members
                <br>
                - Coins were primarily made of copper, silver or gold
                <br>
                - Gold coins were called Auerei, Silver coins were called Denarius and copper coins were called As
                <br>
                - Coins revealed that the ancient Romans traded with India, Iran, Northern Africa and the Mediterranean
                <br>
                - Constantine minted a coin after winning a war over the Alemanni depicting weeping Alemannic tribesmen as a celebration

            <h1>Limitations of Coins</h1>
            <p1>
                While coins reveal a lot of information about the Roman world, it is also important to note coins cannot tell the full story. Coins provide statistical data, but lack insight when it comes to examining Rome from the perspective of the commoner. Historians must rely on other data sets to fill in the blanks like papyri and inscriptions. Other datasets offer insight into the lives of everyday Romans and provide a more "human" aspect of the Roman world. These datasets are usually less preserved than coins, but can reveal important information such as common slang, the ideals of the majority as well as cultural norms at the time.
