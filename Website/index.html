            <h1>Numismatics: The Impact of Coins throughout History</h1>
            <p1>This website is meant to examine coins from the Roman world and highlight the importance of coins in history</p1>
            <p2>This project is primarily focused on coins under Augustus' rule, but will provide an overview of Roman coins in the Roman world as well</p2>

            <h1>What are Numismatics?</h1>
            <p1>Numismatics are the study of coins in history. Researchers examine coin locations as well as physical appearances to draw conclusions about the Roman world.</p1>
            <h2>Physical Appearence of Coins</h2>
            <p2>Coin appearances offer insight into who produced the coin and specific values the ruler possessed. Inscriptions on the coin can also identify who minted the coin and who was in charge of producing coins during an emperor’s rule. Coins are composed of two sides, the obverse (front) and the reverse (back).</p2>
            <h3>The Obverse</h3>
            <p3>Typically depicted a bust of a divine figure or the emperor at the time. Also included inscription of the Emperor’s name</p3>
            <h4>The Reverse</h4>
            <p4>Usually a symbol that represents an emperor’s values. Can also be a monument or a building that was particularly important to the emperor</p4>

            <h1>Augustus</h1>
            <p1>Augustus was Rome’s first emperor. He was born in 63 BC and ruled from 27 BC until his death in 14 AD. During his reign as Rome’s first emperor, he was part of several crucial reforms that lasted hundreds of years. Of these reforms, Augustus’ reform to currency and coins is one of the longest lasting legacies of his rule. He also ruled during a period of peace that lasted roughly 200 years. This enabled him to focus primarily on growth and trade and was one of the few peaceful eras in the Roman Empire.</p1>
            <h2>Augustus' Coin Reform</h2>
            <p2>Augustus’ coin reform was a pivotal decision that helped stabilize Roman economy for nearly 200 years. He introduced smaller denominations below that denarius and used a zinc copper alloy to create these coins. He also minted new gold and silver coins without changing their weight/finesse. The currency he introduced would be used for nearly 200 years before losing its value, far outliving his rule in Rome.</p2>
